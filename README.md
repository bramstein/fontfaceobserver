# Font Face Observer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bramstein/fontfaceobserver.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bramstein/fontfaceobserver)

Font Face Observer is a small `@font-face` loader and monitor (5.2KB minified and 1.9KB gzipped) compatible with any web font service. It will monitor when a web font is applied to the page and notify you. It does not limit you in any way in where, when, or how you load your web fonts. Unlike the [Web Font Loader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader) Font Face Observer uses scroll events to detect font loads efficiently and with minimum overhead.

## How to use

Include your `@font-face` rules as usual. Fonts can be supplied by either a font service such as [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts), [Typekit](http://typekit.com), and [Webtype](http://webtype.com) or be self-hosted. It doesn't matter where, when, or how you load your fonts. You can set up monitoring for a single font family at a time:

```js
var observer = new FontFaceObserver('My Family', {
  weight: 400
});

observer.check().then(function () {
  console.log('Font is available');
}, function () {
  console.log('Font is not available');
});
```

The `FontFaceObserver` constructor takes two arguments: the font family name (required) and an object describing the variation (optional). The object can contain `weight`, `style`, `stretch`, `variant`, and `featureSettings` properties. If a property is not present it will default to `normal`. To start observing font loads, call the `check` method. It'll immediately return a new Promise that resolves when the font is available and rejected when the font is not available.

If your font doesn't contain latin characters you can pass a custom test string to the `check` method.

```js
var observer = new FontFaceObserver('My Family', {});

observer.check('中国').then(function () {
  console.log('Font is available');
}, function () {
  console.log('Font is not available');
});
```

The default timeout for giving up on font loading is 3 seconds. You can increase or decrease this by passing a number of milliseconds as the second parameter to the `check` method.

```js
var observer = new FontFaceObserver('My Family', {});

observer.check(null, 5000).then(function () {
  console.log('Font is available');
}, function () {
  console.log('Font is not available after waiting 5 seconds');
});
```

## Installation

If you're using npm you can install Font Face Observer as a dependency:

```shell
$ npm install fontfaceobserver
```

You can then include `fontfaceobserver/fontfaceobserver.js`. If you're not using npm, grab `fontfaceobserver.js` and include it in your project.
